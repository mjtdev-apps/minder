# Development Plan for Personal Reminder System

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to build a web-based personal reminder system using React, MUI, and AI-driven categorization and prioritization. The system focuses on minimalism and ensures that users receive gentle reminders and prompts without interrupting their deep focus.

## 1. Front-End Setup
- **Technology**: React, MUI
- **Goal**: Establish the look and feel of the application.
- **Key Feature**: Implement the **One-Item Display** feature to show a single reminder at a time.
  - Add buttons to acknowledge or skip reminders.
- **Reminder Input**: Create a simple form to allow users to add reminders (habits, wisdom, deadlines).
  
## 2. AI-Driven Categorization & Prioritization
- **Technology**: OpenAI/LLM or a rule-based classifier.
- **Goal**: Automatically sort reminders into categories (habits, wisdom, deadlines).
  - Prioritize reminders based on urgency and relevance.

## 3. Time-Sensitive Items
- **Goal**: Handle deadlines gracefully with increasing urgency as they approach.
- **Review Section**: Provide a section where users can view all time-sensitive tasks without interrupting the main flow.

## 4. User Flow & Engagement
- **Goal**: Ensure the system is user-driven, meaning users access reminders only when they are ready.
- **One-Item at a Time**: Maintain a single reminder display to avoid overwhelming the user.
- **Future Consideration**: Explore **optional notifications** for time-sensitive tasks.

## 5. Mobile Optimization (Future)
- **Goal**: Ensure the app works seamlessly on mobile devices.
- **Approach**: Apply responsive design principles after the desktop version is stable.

## 6. Backend Setup
- **Technology**: Node.js with SQLite or Firebase
- **Goal**: Implement a lightweight backend to store reminders and categorize them.
  - AI categorization can run asynchronously for a seamless user experience.
