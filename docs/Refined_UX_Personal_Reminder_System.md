# Refined UX Plan for Personal Reminder System

## Key Principles:

### 1. User-Controlled Interaction:
- **No Notifications or Nudges**: The app will not notify or prompt the user. It is a tool they choose to visit when ready, without interruptions.
- **Clear, Focused Layout**: Information is presented in a clear, uncluttered manner, showing what needs to be done today and ongoing habits.

### 2. Prioritized Information Display:
- **Task List and Habit List**: Tasks with specific deadlines (e.g., "Get a haircut today") are shown first, followed by habit reminders (e.g., "Walk 10 minutes").
- **Moral Importance**: Elevate tasks and habits that align with personal growth. 

### 3. Simple, Clear Interaction:
- **Minimal Interaction Options**: Users can mark tasks or habits as done, skip them, or defer them.
- **Effort Over Outcome**: Habits are tracked based on effort, with an emphasis on doing the reps rather than the final result.

### 4. Habit Tracking (Reps, Not Outcomes):
- **Celebrate Reps**: Habits focus on repetition. A visual metaphor (like a jar filling up) shows progress.
- **Jar Metaphor**: As the user completes more reps, a visual jar fills up, celebrating their consistent effort.

### 5. Visual Simplicity:
- **Uncluttered Layout**: Tasks and habits are displayed in a simple, focused way. No extra clutter.
- **Soft Colors and Typography**: Use dark mode as default with clear, easy-to-read typography.

### 6. Habit Forming Encouragement:
- **Rep Celebration**: When a habit is marked complete, a satisfying visual cue reinforces the progress.
- **Long-Term Progress**: For long-term habits, a bar or jar fills up as reps accumulate over time.

## Example User Flow:

### 1. Opening the App:
- The user opens the app to see a prioritized list of today's tasks and habits:
  - **"Haircut at 2:00 PM"** (time-sensitive task).
  - **"Walk 10 minutes"** (habit reminder).
  - **"Meditate for 5 minutes"** (habit reminder).

### 2. Marking Tasks and Habits:
- The user marks tasks as done or defers them if necessary.
- Habits are marked complete once the user "does the rep," and the habit tracker (jar) fills up.

### 3. Closing the App:
- The user closes the app, confident theyâ€™ve seen everything they need to without being distracted or overwhelmed.

## Visual Ideas:
- **Jar Metaphor**: Completing habits moves a visual element (like a jar) closer to being full, reinforcing the idea of consistent progress.
- **Task Prioritization**: Time-sensitive tasks are subtly highlighted (e.g., slight color change) to indicate their importance, without pushing notifications.

## Extensions:
- **Habit Tracking Over Time**: Users can optionally review their habit progress over weeks/months, without being forced to engage with it regularly.
