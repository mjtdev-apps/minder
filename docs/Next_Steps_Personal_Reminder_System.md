# Next Steps for Personal Reminder System Development

## 1. Basic UI Layout Implementation
- **Focus**: Create the initial layout that matches the clear and focused design, with separate sections for time-sensitive tasks and habits.
- **Steps**:
  - Build a simple dashboard using React and MUI that displays tasks and habits.
  - Structure the components for the task list and habit list.
  - Ensure the UI reflects the clean and minimal style discussed, with dark mode enabled by default.

## 2. Habit Tracking Visuals
- **Focus**: Implement the habit tracking system, using a visual metaphor (e.g., a jar filling up).
- **Steps**:
  - Develop the habit tracking component where users can "complete reps" and see visual feedback.
  - Use Framer Motion or MUI’s animation utilities to add subtle animations that represent progress.

## 3. AI-Based Task and Habit Categorization (Basic)
- **Focus**: Implement a basic rule-based system to categorize tasks and habits (AI will come later).
- **Steps**:
  - Create placeholder logic that assigns tasks to “time-sensitive” and habits to “repetitive actions.”
  - Focus on prioritization logic, where more important tasks/habits are surfaced first.

## 4. User Actions and Habit Completion
- **Focus**: Enable users to mark tasks and habits as complete or skip them.
- **Steps**:
  - Add buttons/controls for task and habit completion with tooltips that explain what each action does.
  - Track user interactions (marking a habit complete should trigger a visual response, like filling a jar).

## 5. Non-Intrusive, User-Controlled Design
- **Focus**: Ensure that the system does not notify or nudge the user, but remains a tool they open when ready.
- **Steps**:
  - Disable all notifications and nudges.
  - Ensure the UI is simple and inviting for the user to open and check when they are ready.

## 6. AI Integration for Prioritization (Future Step)
- **Focus**: Once the basics are in place, work on integrating AI for more advanced task and habit prioritization.
- **Steps**:
  - Use an AI model like OpenAI to analyze the user’s patterns, habits, and deadlines, and surface the most relevant tasks/habits.

## 7. Habit Tracking Review (Optional Future Step)
- **Focus**: Allow users to review their habit progress over time.
- **Steps**:
  - Implement a review section that visually displays habit completion over time.
  - Provide options for the user to see weekly or monthly progress if desired.

## Milestone 1: Interactive Wireframe
- By the end of the first milestone, we should have a functioning wireframe that displays tasks and habits, tracks progress visually, and allows the user to complete tasks without clutter or distraction.

## Tools & Tech Stack:
- **Front-End**: React, MUI, Framer Motion (for subtle animations).
- **State Management**: Zustand for managing task and habit states.
- **AI Integration (later)**: OpenAI or a similar model for categorization and prioritization.
