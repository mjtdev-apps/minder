# Personal Reminder System - Web-Based Application
## Vision Statement
This app is designed to gently nudge users with reminders and prompts that encourage better habits, provide wisdom, and surface time-sensitive tasks. The goal is to keep the user’s mind clear and focused during deep work, only providing a gentle guide when they are ready to engage. It prioritizes simplicity, minimalism, and efficiency, with AI-driven prioritization ensuring that only the most relevant thoughts are brought to the forefront.

## Application URL
You can access the application at [https://mjtdev-apps.github.io/minder/](https://mjtdev-apps.github.io/minder/)

## Key Features
- **AI-Driven Categorization & Prioritization**: Automatically sorts reminders into categories like habits, wisdom, or deadlines. Priorities are adjusted over time based on relevance, urgency, and user engagement.
  
- **One Thing at a Time**: The system surfaces only one reminder or thought at a time when the user chooses to check it, preventing overload or distraction.

- **Deadline Management**: Time-sensitive items are handled gracefully, with gentle reminders that become more urgent as deadlines approach. The user can choose to review all time-sensitive items at any time.

- **User-Driven Engagement**: The system never interrupts deep work with intrusive notifications. Instead, users visit the web app when they are ready for guidance, ensuring the reminders are welcome and useful.

- **Search-Like Flow**: Similar to a search engine, the system ranks and displays the most relevant reminder at the top. The user can request another nudge if the current one isn’t applicable.

- **Web-Based for Flexibility**: Accessible through a browser, the app is available across devices. This ensures ease of access without needing to download additional software.

- **Optional Notifications (Future Feature)**: If desired, the system can eventually provide notifications when a time-sensitive item is approaching and requires attention. These will be non-intrusive and configurable.

## How It Works
1. **Adding Reminders**: Users can add reminders as simple text inputs through the web interface. This could be a habit, a deadline, or a word of wisdom. AI/LLM automatically categorizes and adjusts priority levels.
   
2. **Automatic Categorization**: AI scans the reminder to determine if it’s a habit, an inspirational thought, or a deadline-based task. The app prioritizes items based on their urgency and relevance.

3. **One-Item Display**: When the user visits the app, only one item is shown at a time. They can either acknowledge the nudge or request another prompt if the current one isn’t helpful.

4. **Time-Sensitive Item Management**: Time-sensitive reminders are handled delicately. As deadlines approach, the system gently reminds the user, with the option to review all time-sensitive items whenever desired.

5. **Learning Over Time**: The app tracks how users interact with different reminders, learning which prompts are most effective. This helps surface the most helpful or relevant reminders for future use.

6. **Review Section**: A quick-access section for all upcoming deadlines and important tasks allows for occasional review. This is a user-triggered section, not interrupting the natural flow of the system.

## Usage Flow
1. **Daily Usage**:
   - Open the app after completing a deep-work session or during a break.
   - See a single, prioritized nudge/reminder.
   - Either acknowledge the nudge or request another.
   
2. **Occasional Review**:
   - Access a dedicated section that lists all approaching deadlines and high-priority reminders.
   
3. **Adding New Reminders**:
   - Use a simple text input to add new thoughts, habits, or deadlines.
   - AI/LLM categorizes and adjusts priority without any manual tagging required.

## Future Considerations
- **Notifications**: In the future, non-intrusive notifications could be introduced, giving gentle reminders for urgent tasks without interrupting deep focus.
  
- **Mobile Optimization**: Although the app is web-based, a mobile-first design could be introduced to make the app more user-friendly on phones and tablets.

## Technology Stack
- **Front-End**: React or Vue.js for a smooth, responsive UI.
- **Back-End**: Node.js with a lightweight database like SQLite or Firebase for managing reminders.
- **AI/LLM**: OpenAI or a similar service for categorizing and prioritizing reminders based on user inputs.
- **Notifications**: (Future) Integration of browser-based push notifications.

## Conclusion
This web-based personal reminder system is designed for minimalism and efficiency, ensuring users only receive guidance when they’re ready. With a focus on AI-driven prioritization, it ensures that the most relevant and helpful reminders are surfaced at the right time, allowing users to maintain deep focus without feeling overwhelmed by tasks or deadlines.
